<p>Full-stack web developer with a background in journalism and a lifelong love for learning natural languages: Spanish and Portuguese, Arabic (شویة), much dabbling in others. Recently I've begun learning programming languages and libraries: Ruby, Rails, JavaScript, React and Redux, plus the basics: SQL, Git, HTML, CSS. Node and Python are next.</p>

Datawrapper was my favorite, but its limitations made me wish I knew how to build my own charts—or my own charting tools.</em></p>
